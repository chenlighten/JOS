1.Mainly to store the trap number onto the stack, without which the kernel can't tell what kink of interrupt happens.
2.I should set the discriptor privilege level of the page fault IDT entry to be 3 when initialize the IDT.
  Otherwise, when you try to invoke int $14, which requires privilege 0,  in user program in ring 3,
  the hardware compares your privilege and the privilege required and finds that it doesn't match,
  then it will invoke a general protection fault rather than the page fault as you desire.
3.I need to set the discriptor privilege level of the breakpoint IDT entry to be 3. The reason is the same as that in question 2.
4.To prevent the user program from invoking some interrupts that may reveal important data or change the status of the kernel,
  thus protecting the kernel from being attacked via interrupts.
