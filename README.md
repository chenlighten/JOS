# JOS
JOS is a unix-like operating system in the very famous course mit 6.828, and this repo is my solution in the process of building JOS in that course. The whole project is devided into sevaral labs, and each of them deals with one or more important topic in operating system. 

Every lab is represented as a branch in this git repo, you can checkout to the corresbonding branch to see my solution to the labs.

SJTU added some additional problems and features to the original version of the lab, and this repo is in fact for the new version. Here is the homepage for the course https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/courses/os/.

You can also find a document or report that describes the design and solving process of each lab in the corresbonding branch. Here follows the document for lab2, and here is the homepage of lab1 https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/courses/os/labs/joslab2.html.

# Document for lab2 in JOS
I wrote this document with LaTeX, so it can't be presented in README.md. Please check lab2.pdf for it.
